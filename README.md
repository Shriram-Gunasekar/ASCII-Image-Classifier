# ASCII-Image-Classifier
# Image to ASCII Conversion and Classification

This Python script demonstrates how to convert images to ASCII art and perform image classification based on the resulting ASCII text data. 
It uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.


The script will perform the following steps:

- Convert images to ASCII art using the `image_to_ascii` function.
- Preprocess the data and extract features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the vectorized data.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set.
- Make predictions on new ASCII text data (converted from an image) using the trained model.
